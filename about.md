# Frenetic
[![frenetic](/images/frenetic.png)](http://www.frenetic-lang.org) is a family of
languages and tools for network programming, providing a semantic foundation for
trusting network programs. I hack on frenetic's compiler internals and
extensions to the NetKAT semantics, playing with expressions of network
behaviors and constraints so that network administrators don't have to hate
themselves.

# nanomsg
As a software engineer at iZotope, I prototyped the inter-plugin communication
seen in their [Neutron](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/mix/neutron.html)
product using the socket library [nanomsg](http://nanomsg.org).
I [identified](https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg/issues/411)
and [fixed](https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg/pull/413) race conditions in
their in-process and pipe-based transports causing crashes on rebinding and
closing sockets.
